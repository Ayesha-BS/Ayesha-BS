- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Ayesha-BS
- ðŸ‘€ My area of expertise as a Software Quality Assurance (SQA) engineer is guaranteeing the dependability, efficiency, and user-friendliness of software solutions. Having a sharp eye for detail and a strong desire to provide excellent solutions, I work closely with development teams to put testing strategies into place that are reliable and promote product excellence.
- I'm excited to contribute to open source projects, share knowledge, and collaborate with fellow developers and testers to elevate software quality standards across the industry.
